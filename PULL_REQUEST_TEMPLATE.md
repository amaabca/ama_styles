Remember to:

- Add appropriate review symbols to your PR
- I have reviewed my own PR to check syntax & logic, removed unnecessary/old code, made sure everything aligns with our style guide and BEM.
- I've added new components to the style guide (or have a PR in to add them).
- Any applicable version numbers have been updated.
- I've tested on mobile, tablet, and desktop, as well as across all of the browsers we support.
- I've proof-read all text for legibility, proper grammar, punctuation, and capitalization (titlecase).
- I have written a detailed PR message explaining what is being changed and why
- Add a link to any relevant VSTS tickets, or OpsGenie alerts
